        <p class="section-content">Through my digital literacy course, I've delved into crucial topics like online safety, digital footprints, and email etiquette, stressing the significance of adept online management. Digital footprints encapsulate both active and passive data shared online, shaping our online identity and behaviour. Every click, post, or purchase adds to this intricate web. Learning about data collection methods like cookies and tracking pixels prompted a reassessment of privacy settings and exploration of proactive management tools. It's noteworthy how our online activities can impact not just social interactions but also career prospects, a realization especially pertinent as I prepare to enter the job market. Understanding digital footprints, including their effects on social dynamics and consumer behaviour, provided valuable context and underscored the importance of intentional online presence. Exploring monitoring tools equips us with practical strategies for safeguarding privacy and reputation, such as adjusting privacy settings and utilizing browser extensions. Overall, the course has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of digital footprints and practical skills for adept digital navigation, with a commitment to promoting online safety, privacy, and fostering a positive digital presence.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Online Safety and Security</h2>
        <p class="section-content">In today's interconnected world, being safe online is super important. It's like learning how to navigate the digital world without getting into trouble. Imagine protecting your personal stuff like bank details and private information from bad guys on the internet. That's what we're talking about. We've got to understand the risks out there, like viruses, scams, and sneaky emails trying to steal our info. By knowing about these threats, we can be smarter about how we use the internet and keep ourselves safe. There are three key things we can do to stay safe online: make sure the websites we visit are secure (you'll see "https" in the URL), be careful about what we click on or download, and use strong passwords. It's like locking the doors to our digital lives! We also need to be careful about who we share our stuff with online. Adjusting privacy settings and being cautious about who we accept as friends can help prevent us from falling into traps set by online scammers. Learning about all this stuff isn't a one-time thing. We need to keep updating our skills and staying alert because the internet is always changing. But by doing so, we can feel more confident and ready to tackle whatever the digital world throws at us. This knowledge not only helps us stay safe but also makes us better at thinking critically and solving problems in our digital lives.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Email Etiquette</h2>
        <p class="section-content">"I've learned that sending emails the right way is super important in today's digital world. Whether you're talking to friends or colleagues, using good email manners helps keep relationships strong and makes sure your message is clear. So, what makes a good email? Well, it's all about being polite, keeping things short and easy to understand, and making sure your email looks nice. That means using a clear subject line, saying hi nicely, and ending with a friendly goodbye. It's also important to organize your email well, with paragraphs that make sense. And did you know how your email looks matters too? Things like using spaces well, making things bold when needed, and sticking to normal fonts and sizes all make your email look more professional. How you talk in emails matters too. Using formal language without slang shows you're respectful. And it's a good idea to adjust how you talk depending on who you're emailing. Another important thing is managing your emails well. Using clear subject lines helps people know what your email is about, so they can deal with it quickly. When you're sending files, it's important to do it right. Label your attachments clearly so people know what they are, and think about how big your files are. Sometimes it's better to use something like Google Drive instead. Learning all this in my digital literacy class has been really helpful. Following these rules makes sure your emails are clear, professional, and make a good impression, which helps you build good relationships and get things done."</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Cyber Security</h2>
        <p class="section-content">I've learned some really important stuff about staying safe online and protecting my digital stuff. One big thing is using strong passwords. That means making them tricky by mixing up letters, numbers, and symbols. It's also smart to avoid using easy-to-guess stuff like your birthday or common words. Changing passwords regularly is another good idea to keep hackers out. And it's best not to use the same password for different accounts because if one gets hacked, they could all be at risk. 
I've also learned to watch out for phishing scams. That's when bad guys try to trick you into giving them your personal info through fake emails or websites. I always double-check links and look out for any mistakes in the web addresses. When I'm shopping online, I make sure to use websites that are secure and have safe ways to pay. It's also a good idea to avoid using public Wi-Fi for anything sensitive because it's easier for hackers to get into your stuff that way. Encrypting my data is like putting a lock on it to keep it safe from prying eyes. And backing up my files regularly is like having a spare key in case something goes wrong with my device. 
Lastly, I've learned to be careful about what I share on social media and other online accounts. Privacy settings can help keep my info safe from people who shouldn't have it. All of this advice has really helped me feel more confident and secure online.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Search and Credibility</h2>
        <p class="section-content">In our digital literacy class, we learned a lot about how to search for information online and why it's so important to make sure that the sources we use are trustworthy. We talked about how there's a ton of information on the internet, so it's crucial to know how to find what you need efficiently. One big focus was on figuring out how to search effectively. This means setting clear goals for what you want to find and using tricks like using "AND," "OR," and "Minus" to refine your searches. We also learned about some cool tricks like exact match and wildcard searches, which can help you find exactly what you're looking for. But it's not just about finding information â€“ it's also about making sure that the information you find is reliable. We talked about things like checking who wrote an article or when it was published to see if it's up-to-date. We also learned about peer review, which is when experts check an article before it's published to make sure it's accurate. By the end of the course, we felt a lot more confident navigating the internet and finding good information. We're excited to put our new skills to use and make sure that we're contributing positively to online conversations.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">AI, Ethics in AI, Generative AI</h2>
        <p class="section-content">In the digital literacy class, we've been talking a lot about artificial intelligence (AI) and how it's changing the world. We've learned that AI can be really helpful, but it also brings up some important ethical questions. Basically, AI is technology that can think and learn like humans. It's used in lots of different industries, from healthcare to finance to entertainment. But sometimes, the way AI works can cause problems. For example, AI algorithms can be biased, meaning they might treat certain groups unfairly. And when AI collects data about us, it can raise concerns about our privacy. We've also talked about how AI can lead to job losses because it can do some tasks better and faster than people. Plus, there's the issue of control. As AI gets smarter, it might start making decisions for us, which could affect our freedom to choose. To deal with these issues, we've been discussing concepts like transparency, justice, and accountability. These are all about making sure that AI is used in a fair and responsible way. We've looked at real-life examples to understand how tricky it can be to balance the benefits of AI with the risks. We talked about how to make sure AI is used ethically. This means having rules in place, designing AI systems carefully, being clear about how they work, and involving everyone who might be affected. We also looked at a type of AI called Generative AI, which can make things like images and text on its own. But using it raises questions about whether what it creates is real, if it breaks any laws, and how it might change how we interact with technology and each other. We found that taking a course on understanding technology better helped people see the ethical side of AI. They want to use what they learned to use technology in a fair, kind, and smart way. They hope to help</p>
